**Language-Identification-For-Multilingual-Machine-Translation**

This project is a desktop application that identifies the language of an input text and translates it into a selected target language. It uses machine learning models for language detection and integrates Google Translate for real-time translation. The project is built with a user-friendly GUI using Tkinter.

ðŸš€ Features

* Detects the language of a given input text
* Translates text into the selected target language using Google Translate
* GUI interface for easy interaction
* Multiple ML models (KNN, SVM, Random Forest) for language detection
* Preprocessing and feature extraction using TF-IDF

ðŸ§  Machine Learning Models Used

* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Random Forest Classifier

ðŸ§° Technologies & Tools

* Python
* Tkinter(GUI)
* scikit-learn(ML algorithms)
* TF-IDF Vectorizer
* Googletrans(for translation)
* langdetect(for dataset-based language detection)
  
ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements

* Add speech-to-text input
